ssing -- synthesized singer

GOAL:

* There is a source singer (real) and a target singer (generated). Goal is to have source singer sing arbitrary material and convert it to a performance by the target singer.

ASSUMPTIONS:

* Source singer can sing any material

* Target singer training data consists of specific historical performances (not the ones we want to create)

STEPS:

* acquire a-capella performances of Target (preferably with original mixed version or separated backing tracks)

* have Source sing performances as close to matching Target as possible. Source/Target performance pairs are training data

* Train ML model to derive Target from Source for training material

* Apply model to Source data for which there is no actual Target data (ie songs Target never sang as far as we know)
